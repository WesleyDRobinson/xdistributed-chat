                            When a browser navigates to <a href="//distributed.now.sh" class="link orange hover-blue">Distributed Chat</a>, it spawns a node on the IPFS network. <br><br>
                            Each time an IPFS node is created, a unique Id is assigned and used as a Peer ID. <br><br>
                            To communicate with others on the platform, enter a room name. <br><br> 
                            You'll join a room where messages may be broadcast. <br><br>
                            Peers already in the room will be notified that a new peer has joined. <br><br>
                            Exit a room, and peers will also be notified. <br><br>
                            Once you leave a room, all messages effectively vanish <br><br>
                            Leaving distributed chat will close the IPFS node. <br><br>

                            Be sure to save this link before navigating away from the chat or you won't be able to find it again! <br><br>

                    <p class="pa2">distributed chat complements these tools, but offers a unique experience.<br>
                        You have a private chat if you enter the same room as one other person.<br>
                        You have a group chat if more peers join the room.<br>
                        While you can't stop peers from joining your room, choosing a long or hard to guess name reduces the chance of others joining. <br>
                        Even if someone joins your room, they can't see what you've been chatting about‚Äîonly what you say moving forward.
