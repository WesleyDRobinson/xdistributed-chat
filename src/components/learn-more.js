                            When a browser navigates to <a href="//distributed.now.sh" class="link orange">Distributed Chat</a>, it spawns a node on the IPFS network. <br><br>
                            Each time an IPFS node is created, a unique Id is assigned and used as a Peer ID. <br><br>
                            To communicate with others on the platform, enter a room name. <br><br> 
                            You'll join a room where messages may be broadcast. <br><br>
                            Peers already in the room will be notified that a new peer has joined. <br><br>
                            Exit a room, and peers will also be notified. <br><br>
                            Once you leave a room, all messages effectively vanish <br><br>
                            Leaving distributed chat will close the IPFS node. <br><br>
                            Refreshing the window will spawn a fresh IFPS node, with a new unique Peer Id.

                            When you upload a file, it is added to your IPFS node, and a link to an IPFS<>HTTP gateway is broadcast. <br><br> 
                            Be sure to save this link before navigating away from the chat or you won't be able to find it again! <br><br>
                            The file content will only persist as long as some node on the network hosts it. In this regard, it is similar to web torrents. <br><br>
